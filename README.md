## üöÄ Getting Started with Supabase

This application requires a Supabase project to handle its backend functionality.

### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project
1.  Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  Save your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**. You will need these for the environment variables.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
To run or deploy this application, you must configure the following environment variables:

-   `API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key.
-   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
-   `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase project's `anon` public key.

### Step 3: Set Up the Database Schema
Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard and run the SQL script below. This will create all the necessary tables, types, and relationships.

**COPY AND PASTE THE ENTIRE SCRIPT BELOW INTO THE SUPABASE SQL EDITOR AND RUN IT.**

```sql
-- Create custom enum type for user roles
CREATE TYPE public.user_role AS ENUM (
    'Employee',
    'Admin'
);

-- Create the users table to store public profile information
CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name text,
    email text UNIQUE,
    role public.user_role DEFAULT 'Employee'::public.user_role NOT NULL,
    approved boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL,
    points integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
    badges text[] DEFAULT '{}'::text[] NOT NULL,
    profile_image_url text,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create the courses table
CREATE TABLE public.courses (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    description text,
    image_url text,
    textbook_url text,
    textbook_name text,
    modules jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    quiz jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    discussion jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create the reviews table
CREATE TABLE public.reviews (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    author_name text,
    rating integer NOT NULL,
    comment text,
    "timestamp" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create user progress table
CREATE TABLE public.user_progress (
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    course_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    completed_modules text[] DEFAULT '{}'::text[] NOT NULL,
    quiz_score integer,
    rating integer,
    recently_viewed timestamp with time zone,
    completion_date timestamp with time zone,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id)
);

-- Create notifications table
CREATE TABLE public.notifications (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    type text NOT NULL,
    message text NOT NULL,
    read boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL,
    "timestamp" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create external resources table
CREATE TABLE public.external_resources (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    description text,
    url text NOT NULL,
    type text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create a function to increment user points safely
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_points(user_id uuid, points_to_add integer)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE public.users
  SET points = points + points_to_add
  WHERE id = user_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 4: Create a Database Trigger for New Users
When a new user signs up with Supabase Auth, an entry is created in the `auth.users` table. We need a trigger to automatically copy that user's information into our public `users` table.

1.  In the Supabase Dashboard, go to **Database** -> **Triggers**.
2.  Click **Create a new trigger**.
3.  Choose the `users` table from the `auth` schema.
4.  Give the function a name like `handle_new_user`.
5.  In the SQL definition, paste the following code:

```sql
-- This trigger automatically creates a profile in public.users
-- when a new user signs up in auth.users.
begin
  insert into public.users (id, name, email)
  values (
    new.id,
    new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name',
    new.email
  );
  return new;
end;
```
5.  For the "Events", check the **Insert** box.
6.  Click **Confirm** to create the trigger.

### Step 5: Set up Supabase Storage
1. In the Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage**.
2. Click **New bucket**.
3. Name the bucket `assets` and make it a **public** bucket.
4. Click **Create bucket**.

Your application is now fully configured to work with Supabase!

## üîê Security Best Practices

With Supabase, your application is much more secure, but for a real production environment, you must enable **Row Level Security (RLS)**.

-   **What is RLS?** RLS allows you to write database policies that restrict which rows users can access or modify. For example:
    -   Users should only be able to view and edit their own profile in the `users` table.
    -   Users should only be able to modify their own progress in the `user_progress` table.
    -   Only users with the 'Admin' role should be able to create or delete courses.
-   **Why is it important?** Without RLS, any user with your `anon` key could potentially access or modify any data in your database via the API.
-   **How to enable it:** In the Supabase Dashboard, go to **Authentication** -> **Policies**. You can write SQL policies for each table to define access rules. Please consult the [Supabase RLS documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) for detailed guides.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is ready for deployment on static hosting platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

To deploy:
1.  Commit the entire project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  Connect your repository to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
3.  Configure the build settings (usually no special settings are needed).
4.  **Crucially**, set the **three** environment variables (`API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in your hosting provider's project settings. The application is built to read these variables directly.
