## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **Certificate Generation**: `html2canvas`, `jspdf`
- **Data Persistence**: `LocalStorage` (for demonstration purposes)

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a self-contained browser environment where the Gemini API key is provided as an environment variable.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser.
- The `API_KEY` for the Google Gemini service must be configured in the deployment environment.

### Running the Application
1.  The application is served via `index.html`.
2.  The main application logic is in `index.tsx`, which is loaded as a module.
3.  All dependencies like React and `@google/genai` are loaded via an `importmap` from a CDN, requiring no local installation.

## üîê Security Warning

This project is intended for **demonstration purposes only**. Several components are implemented in a simplified way that is **not secure for a production environment**:

1.  **Authentication**: User credentials (email and plaintext passwords) are stored directly in the client-side code (`constants.ts`). **This is a major security vulnerability.** In a real-world application, authentication must be handled by a secure backend server that stores hashed passwords and uses a token-based system (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
2.  **Data Storage**: All application data (users, courses, progress) is stored in the browser's `LocalStorage`. This data is not persistent, is not shared between users, and can be easily manipulated by the end-user. A production application requires a secure backend and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
3.  **Authorization**: User roles are managed on the client-side, which is insecure. A backend should always validate a user's permissions before performing any action.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is ready for deployment on static hosting platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

To deploy:
1.  Commit the entire project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  Connect your repository to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
3.  Configure the build settings (usually no special settings are needed for a Vite/CRA-like setup).
4.  **Crucially**, set the `API_KEY` as an **environment variable** in your Vercel project settings. The key should be named `API_KEY`. The application is built to read this variable directly.
